Currently, there are two editions of WebPivotTable: free edition and Pro edition.

## Free Edition

Free edition has all functionalities of WebPivotTable except the ability to load source data through API. 

<p class="Alert Alert--info">
WebPivotTable Free Edition is totally free to any person or any company, either for personal use or for commercial use.
You can go to [Download Page](/download) to download a copy of this edition, integarte it into your web site or web application
and use it right away. No license needed.
</p>

The most popular use case of free edition is to analyse data from data files. Through intuitive user interface,
you can load source data from a data file existing on your local drive, cloud drives or on a web server and be published as a internet link.
The file format can be most popular data file format, like CSV, TSV, Excel and Google Spreadsheet.

Another use case of free edition is to use it as a front end client for any OLAP(Online Analytical Processing) server,
like Microsoft Analytic Service and Mondrian open source OLAP server. Although each OLAP server may provide its own front end client,
for example, Excel is front end client for Microsoft Analytic Service and JPivot if a front end client for Mondrian OLAP Server,
WebPivotTable can provide better user experience than those clients since it is web based and has very intuitive user interface.
Another advantage of using WebPivotTable is it is free and follows XMLA standard so that it doesn't bind with any particular OLAP server.

WebPivotTable free edition allows you to save your analysis in a WPT format file and load this file later.
This is great for sharing data analytic with others. You can send this file to anybody else and they can open it through
any WebPivotTable application, either it is the same WebPivotTable application with you, or any other installed WebPivotTable applications. Once opened, everything resume back to exactly the same as when you save the file.


## Pro Edition

Pro edition includes all functionalities of free edition, but add the support of APIs
for developers to load source data from any data sources.

<p class="Alert Alert--info">
WebPivotTable Pro edition is not free and any commercial use of it should purchase a license.
Before making a purchase, you can go to [Download Page](/download) to request a trial version of this edition by filling up a simple form.
</p>

A typical use case of Pro edition is to load source data from server side. Pro edition provides APIs
for integration developer to load data into WebPivotTable programmatically, either directly from data file URL links or web services,
or first retrieve data from server side to front end then load it as a data array.
These APIs open doors to load any kinds of enterprise data, especially data stores in database system.
End users can all access these data without knowing the storage details.

Another use case of edition is to save all data analysis to the server and reload it by anybody else from the server.
This makes sharing data analytic within enterprise or organization quite easy.

Embed WebPivotTable into other BI products or SaaS solutions is also a popular use case.
Not only the user interface of WebPivotTable can be customized, but also it can communicate with other parts of
products or solutions bidirectionally.


By embedded WebPivotTable into enterprise web site or web application, all employees within this enterprise can easily access the same data source and do any data analysis in their browsers. The data analysis results and reports can easily be shared to anybody else.  
  
Business intelligence software providers can also easily OEM WebPivotTable into their web software and distribute it to their customers, or embedded it into their SaaS (Software as a service) solutions which serve unlimited web users.
