WebPivotTable folllows new Web Component standard and it works very well with all kinds of javascript environments.

To integrate WebPivotTable, we only need to import one javascript file into web page like:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="./dist/wpt.js"></script>
```

Then, we can put a "wpt-pivot-table" tag into page:
```html
<body>
  <div id="wpt-container">
    <web-pivot-table />
  </div>
</body>
``` 

## Web Component

## Jquery

## React

## Vue

## Angular

## Ember

## Polymer
