In a text command to create a DECIMAL column with a precision of 10 and a scale of 2, the value of the TYPE_NAME column might be DECIMAL() and the complete type specification would be DECIMAL(10,2). The creation parameters appear as a comma-separated list of values, in the order they are to be supplied and with no surrounding parentheses. If a creation parameter is length, maximum length, precision, scale, seed, or increment, use \"length\", \"max length\", \"precision\", \"scale\", \"seed\", and \"increment\", respectively. If the creation parameter is some other value, the provider determines what text is to be used to describe the creation parameter. If the data type requires creation parameters, \"()\" usually appears in the type name. This indicates the position at which to insert the creation parameters. If the type name does not include \"()\", the creation parameters are enclosed in parentheses and appended to the data type name. </td>\r\n    *            <td>false</td>\r\n    *            <td>true</td>\r\n    *        </tr>\r\n    *        <tr>\r\n    *            <td>IS_NULLABLE</td>\r\n    *            <td>boolean</td>\r\n    *            <td>A Boolean that indicates whether the data type is nullable.
